Why your participation matters?This website is part of the PhD research project entitled Shaping a digital memory platform on migration narratives: A public history project on migration memories in Luxembourg, conducted by Anita Lucchesi in the Center for Contemporary and Digital History (University of Luxembourg), and funded by the  National Research Fund, Luxembourg.

The research aims at studying migration memories and narratives in Luxembourg combining a plural cultural history framework with a systematical historical analysis of the mediated memories of migrants in the Grand Duchy. Approaching the subject from the perspective of History from Below and using an innovative methodological apparatus built on oral history and digital public history methods this research expects to encounter an alternative way of storytelling through digital technology, engaging community members with acknowledgment to their own agency as historical actors. To access and interpret the migration narratives of diverse generations of migrants in Luxembourg, the project will employ a digital toolkit which will be tested in the examination of different bodies of sources (egodocuments, oral history, online published material), enabling a “scalable reading” text analysis of the whole corpora. One of the main outcomes of this project, besides the PhD thesis itself, is the shaping, in collaboration with the community, of Memorecord platform for an alternative digital storytelling about migration in Luxembourg, aiming at sharing memories of different generations and communities online and, hopefully, going beyond the master narrative about migration in Luxembourg we already know. What is behind and beyond the successful story of migration in Luxembourg?

The process of building and running this platform as an example of doing public history with the means of digital tools and technologies is the central empirical challenge of this project. The platform will allow testing digital methods (i.e. crowdsourcing, web scraping, social media analysis, distant reading, topic modeling) for doing digital history online and to actively engage with the “object of study” itself. By doing so, the projects aims at contributing to the Luxembourgish historiography on migration, as well as to reflect on the methodological and epistemological debates in the field of digital public history / digital humanities, by evaluating the effect of digital enabled methods and the specificities of digital source criticism to the historiographical operation.
