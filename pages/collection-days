Luxembourg is  pot where more than 170 nationalities come together. Event If you were born in the Grand Duchy, you might have already met someone with a migration experience, or maybe your family has one. We are interested in the ordinary people memories about migration in Luxembourg. So, independently of you being a migrant yourself or not, having close relatives, neighbours or friends that came from other countries â€“ if you have something to share, we would like to know.

If you feel like sharing it face-to-face or if you have pictures, old documents and objects that you would like to add to your story, join one of the Exchange & Collection Days with Memocord 2.0: 

Day 1: Welcome, xx/xx/xxxx

Day 2: Cuisine du Monde, xx/xx/xxxx

Day 3: CDHM, RDV de Dimanche - "Racontez votre histoire de vie", xx/xx/xxxx

Day 4: Festival des Migration, xx/xx/xxxx

Day 5: Festival des Migration, xx/xx/xxxx

[add to calendar function + registration function]

The idea of going offline and having a real meeting is also for bringing people together and listening about what they would like get from this project. Memocord 2.0 is only possible wih your participation, so please, feel free to join it online or offline, and drop your feedback at anytime.
