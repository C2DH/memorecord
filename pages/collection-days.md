Luxembourg is  pot where more than 170 nationalities come together. Event If you were born in the Grand Duchy, you might have already met someone with a migration experience, or maybe your family has one. We are interested in the ordinary people memories about migration in Luxembourg. So, independently of you being a migrant yourself or not, having close relatives, neighbours or friends that came from other countries â€“ if you have something to share, we would like to know.

If you feel like sharing it face-to-face or if you have pictures, old documents and objects that you would like to add to your story, join one of the Exchange & Collection Days with Memorecord:
