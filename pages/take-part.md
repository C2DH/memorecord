##Why your participation matters?

This project has one big question as its North: What is behind and beyond the successful story of migration in Luxembourg?

This questions is motivated by the fact that, not only in the public opinion, but also in Academia, we constantly find statements and evidence supporting the positive development of migration movements in the country. The original idea here is not making a research to merely prove or neglect something on this direction. The objective of the collection to be built through the Memorecord's crowdsourcing is not saying whether this "success story" is true or false, good or bad. The interest in looking behind and beyond this is trying to understand, in a more qualitative, holistic way, what else than good economic markers and the harmonious living together have been playing a role for Luxembourg becoming such a particular case of migration in the world. 

We learn from different studies that migration, as an old global phenomenon, is a process that may be full of non-dits  ruptures (...) TBC
