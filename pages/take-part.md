Community participation is the soul of this crowdsourcing experiment. By taking part in this collective project, your memories and personal accounts can help us to understand more about the historical aspects of migration in the Grand Duchy.

#memorecord is collecting all posts related to memories of migration in Luxembourg. Join the harvest! Use #memorecord on your Facebook and Instagram posts.

# How #memorecord works?

All the public posts on Facebook and Instagram tagged with the project’s hashtag  (#memorecord) will be gathered and displayed in our website gallery, under [Stories](https://c2dh.github.io/memorecord/stories/). The collection respects the privacy settings of the users and their original posts within Facebook and Instagram, therefore only posts that are open and public will be collected. If a post is deleted on Facebook or Instagram, it will be deleted on our gallery as well. 

If you want to share something privately, you are also welcome to contact the project curator by [e-mail](mailto:anita.lucchesi@uni.lu). 

# Why your participation matters? 

One of the main questions #memorecord wants to answer is “What is behind and beyond the successful story of migration in Luxembourg?”. The more people participate, the more diverse our collection will be, the more plural and democratic our answer can be. 

#memorecord welcomes Luxembourgers and migrants of all nationalities to share their memories about migration in the  Grand Duchy. All languages are welcome. Add your piece to this mosaic of memories. Join the harvest!
