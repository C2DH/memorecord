**Memorecord** is a digital public history project curated by Anita Lucchesi, an Italo-Brazilian historian at the Center for Contemporary and Digital History (University of Luxembourg), who is doing her PhD about the implications of digital tools and methods in history and have memories of migration in Luxembourg as her empirical subject. 

**Memorecord** is aimed at collecting personal stories and memories about migration in Luxembourg shared on the web while experimenting the method of crowdsourcing sources for History.  

The goal of this experiment is bringing together **community participation and academic effort** for presenting another view on the history of migration in Luxembourg, based on the crowdsourced multimedia material collected via this the project's channels: Instagram (@memorecord), Facebook (www.facebok.com/memocorecord) and this website, all assembled via the hashtag #memorecord. 

Ideally, this crowdsourcing experiment will result in an original collection which will be the basis for Anita's PhD research. The expectation is to find as much as stories as possible, adding different voices and experiences to the primary material that Anita will analyze in her doctoral thesis.

*Note: the official crowdsourcing experiment might last until 30 June 2018 because, as it is part of an on going PhD research, at a certain point it will have to have an end. Anyway, the hashtag is public and there is absolutely no problem if there is spontaneous use of it, as many things on the web, it may have a natural continuity.
