**Memorecord** is a digital public history project curated by Anita Lucchesi, an Italo-Brazilian historian at the Center for Contemporary and Digital History (University of Luxembourg), who is doing her PhD about the implications of digital tools and methods in history and have memories of migration in Luxembourg as her empirical subject. 

**Memorecord** is aimed at collecting personal stories and memories about migration in Luxembourg shared on the web while experimenting the method of crowdsourcing sources for History.  

The goal of this experiment is bringing together **community participation and academic effort** for presenting another view on the history of migration in Luxembourg, based on the crowdsourced multimedia material collected via this the project's channels: Instagram (@memorecord), Facebook (www.facebok.com/memocorecord) and this website, all assembled via the hashtag #memorecord. 

Ideally, this crowdsourcing experiment will result in an original collection which will be the basis for Anita's PhD research. The expectation is to find as much as stories as possible, adding different voices and experiences to the primary material that Anita will analyze in her doctoral thesis.

*Note: the official crowdsourcing experiment might last until 30 June 2018 because, as it is part of an on going PhD research, at a certain point it will have to have an end. Anyway, the hashtag is public and there is absolutely no problem if there is spontaneous use of it, as many things on the web, it may have a natural continuity. 

## Academic background

This website is part of the PhD research project entitled *Shaping a digital memory platform on migration narratives: A public history project on migration memories in Luxembourg*, conducted by Anita Lucchesi in the **Center for Contemporary and Digital History** (University of Luxembourg), and funded by the  National Research Fund, Luxembourg.

The research aims at studying migration memories and narratives in Luxembourg combining a plural cultural history framework with a systematical historical analysis of the mediated memories of migrants in the Grand Duchy. Approaching the subject from the perspective of History from Below and using an innovative methodological apparatus built on oral history and digital public history methods this research expects to encounter an alternative way of storytelling through digital technology, engaging community members with acknowledgment to their own agency as historical actors. To access and interpret the migration narratives of diverse generations of migrants in Luxembourg, the project will employ a digital toolkit which will be tested in the examination of different bodies of sources (egodocuments, oral history, online published material), enabling a “scalable reading” text analysis of the whole corpora. One of the main outcomes of this project, besides the PhD thesis itself, is the shaping, in collaboration with the community, of Memorecord platform for an alternative digital storytelling about migration in Luxembourg, aiming at sharing memories of different generations and communities online and, hopefully, going beyond the master narrative about migration in Luxembourg we already know. What is behind and beyond the successful story of migration in Luxembourg?

The process of building and running this platform as an example of doing public history with the means of digital tools and technologies is the central empirical challenge of this project. The platform will allow testing digital methods (i.e. crowdsourcing, web scraping, social media analysis, distant reading, topic modeling) for doing digital history online and to actively engage with the “object of study” itself. By doing so, the projects aims at contributing to the Luxembourgish historiography on migration, as well as to reflect on the methodological and epistemological debates in the field of digital public history / digital humanities, by evaluating the effect of digital enabled methods and the specificities of digital source criticism to the historiographical operation.
